# Project Name: Poll App (Backend)

## Description
This is a simple poll app backend. It is built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. It is a simple API that allows users to check out polls
It also uses GraphQL to query the database and return the data (witch is filled with dummy data at seed with Faker gem), For last it uses GraphiQL to test the queries in development. The idea here is just to show data to the user and don't allow him to create, edit or delete anything.

### Extra info

## Features
- Query polls
- Query Answers
- Query Users
- Query Votes

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
- Ruby
- Rails
- PostgreSQL
- Git

### Setup
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Run `bundle install` to install the required gems
- Setup your database authentication in `config/database.yml`
- Run `rails db:create` to create the database
- Run `rails db:migrate` to migrate the database
- Run `rails db:seed` to seed the database with dummy data
- Run `rails server --port=5000` to start the server (port 5000 recommended to avoid conflicts with the frontend server)

### Usage
